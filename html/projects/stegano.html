                <p class="text-content">Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary,
                    non-secret, file or message
                    in order to avoid detection. The data is stored in inside an ordinary media file such as an
                    image or
                    video or maybe an audio file. This done to avoid suspicion, as using an ordinary file does not
                    attract attention.

                <p class="text-content">
                    Steganography can be used to conceal any forms of digital data – image/text/audio/video. And not
                    just that, any form of digital data can be concealed in any form of digital data. In modern
                    practices, often the data to be hidden is first encrypted in some form and then concealed inside
                    of
                    media files. This adds a layer of security to the data.

                    This project speaks of how image steganography works. There exist two implementations - one with
                    hiding an image inside of another, the other involves hiding plain text inside of an image. So
                    how
                    exactly do you think this process works?
                </p>

                <p class="text-content">
                    The idea of steganography for this project is achieved with the <b>LSB</b> (Least Significance
                    Bit)
                    technique - by pixel value
                    modifications, although there are different and much better/efficient ways to do this, but LSB
                    technique is quite easy to understand and so is its implementation.

                    Every pixel in an image is composed of three
                    primary colours, and the intensity of each of the
                    three primary colours determines the colour of the pixel. Every colour in a pixel is represented
                    as
                    an integer in the range 0 – 255. Therefore every colour can be represented as 8-bit binary
                    number.

                <p class="text-content">
                    If we were to look at the values (r, g, and b) (for example) of a pixel in decimal
                    representation, we get something like: rgb(24, 200, 120) this representation can be split
                    into three parts – red (24), green (200) and blue (120). Each of these numbers can be
                    represented in binary as an 8-bit binary number – red (0001_1000), green (1100_1000)
                    and blue (0111_1000). Here each representation in binary is split into MSBs and LSBs
                    using an underscore. Refer Fig. 1.

                    As the value of any number depends on its most significant digit, therefore altering the
                    least significant digit would not change its value by any significant amount. We use this
                    concept to implement steganography.

                <h4>1. Img2img - to hide an image inside of another</h4>
                <br>

                <p class="text-content">
                    The basic idea of this process is to hide an image inside of another. In other words, given
                    a cover/foreground image and a message image (message image is to hidden inside of the
                    cover image) the process produces a third image in which the message image is to be hidden
                    inside of the cover image. The output image holds enough information to reproduce the
                    two inputted images. This is done using the extraction process, about which we will discuss
                    further.
                    Let us denote each of the images as follows: message image as <em>'message'</em>,
                    foreground/cover
                    image as <em>'foreground'</em> and output image as
                    <em>'output'</em>.
                </p>

                <br>
                <h5>1.1 Process</h5>

                <p class="text-content">
                    For this process, <em>'output'</em> is produced from the given two input images.
                    The <em>'output'</em> is the result of hiding one image inside of another. The pixel values of
                    the <em>'output'</em> are the resultant of adding the MSBs of the pixel values of the
                    two images. The <em>'message'</em> is substituted in the
                    lower order (as LSBs in <em>'output'</em>) whereas the image that is insignificant that is
                    <em>'foreground'</em>,
                    its MSBs are placed in the higher order (as MSBs) in the <em>'output'</em>. The output image is
                    seen
                    with pixels values mainly from the foreground image. This is done three times – once for
                    each colour and this happens for every pixel.
                </p>

                <p class="text-content">
                    This process can be visualized in the following way: suppose we have two pixels from
                    the <em>'foreground'</em> and <em>'message'</em> with red value = 72 (= fore_red, for
                    <em>'foreground'</em>) and red value =
                    127 (= msg_red, for <em>'message'</em>). We will visualize this only for the red pixel.
                </p>

                <p class="text-content-center"><b>fore_red = 72d</b> and <b>msg_red = 127d</b></p>
                <p class="text-content">the binary representations of each are:</p>
                <p class="text-content-center"><b>fore_red = 0100_0111b</b> and <b>msg_red = 0111_1111b</b></p>

                <p class="text-content">
                    Let’s say the <em>'output'</em> image’s red value of the corresponding pixel is
                    <b>'out_red'</b>,
                    further steps are as shown below:
                </p>

                <div class="center-image">
                    <figure class="figure">

                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p class="text-content">
                    We observe that <b>out_red = 71d</b> which is closer to <b>fore_red = 72d</b>. Here we observe
                    that
                    MSBs
                    mostly determine the magnitude of a number. As we have seen here, the number
                    of bits replaced in the <em>'output'</em> is equal to 4, depending upon the preference and the
                    choice
                    of quality after extraction we can replace lesser or more than 4 bits the similar way.

                </p>

                <p class="text-content">
                    The mathematical calculation performed on each pixel to achieve this replacement is as
                    follows:
                </p>

                <p class="text-content-center"><b>out_red = floor(fore_red / divider) * divider + floor(msg_red /
                        divider)</b></p>
                <p class="text-content">where, divider = 2 ^ (number of bits to replace)</p>

                <p class="text-content">
                    This is performed without converting the pixel values into binary, rather it is performed
                    on decimal values itself.
                </p>

                <p class="text-content">
                    For example, as visualized above, let fore_red = 72d, msg_red = 127d, divider = 2^4 = 16, then
                    using
                    the above equation to find out_red:
                </p>

                <p class="text-content-center"><b>out_red = floor(72 / 16) * 16 + floor(127 / 16)</b></p>
                <p class="text-content-center"><b>= 4 * 16 + 7</b></p>
                <p class="text-content-center"><b>out_red = 71d</b></p>
                <br>

                <h5>1.1 Extraction</h5>

                <p class="text-content">
                    While extraction (we produce two images – message and foreground) as we have seen;
                    only the MSBs play a main role in the intensity of a colour. Therefore while extracting
                    the images, the images are formed in the following way:
                </p>

                <p class="text-content">
                    The pixels from the <em>'output'</em> are used to extract the MSBs and LSBs. The MSBs of
                    pixels from the <em>'output'</em> represent the <em>'foreground'</em> and the LSBs represent the
                    <em>'foreground'</em> image. After performing mathematical operations on these pixel values, we
                    can
                    extract the MSBs and the LSBs. As we have seen, only the MSBs mostly determine the
                    colour intensity of the pixel, therefore as a procedure of extraction, we reproduce two
                    images from the <em>'output'</em> image. One – is the image using the MSBs
                    (<em>'foreground'</em>)
                    and the
                    second – is the image using the LSBs from the <em>'output'</em> image. The remaining LSB bits in
                    both – <em>'message'</em> and <em>'foreground'</em> image are substituted as 0s. Substituting
                    the
                    LSBs as 0s
                    in these two images does not affect the images in any considerable way. In fact, the images
                    (before
                    steganography and after extraction) when compared look quite similar.
                </p>

                <p class="text-content">
                    This process can be visualized in the following way: suppose we have the output pixel (out_red
                    - like discussed above) with red value = 71d
                </p>

                    Let’s say the two extracted images have the same notation (fore_red and msg_red), the extraction

                    be visualized in the following way:

                </p>

                <p class="text-content-center"><b>msg_red = (71 % 16) * 16</b></p>
                <p class="text-content-center"><b> = 7 * 16</b></p>
                <p class="text-content-center"><b>msg_red = 112d</b></p>

                <p class="text-content">
                    Therefore the extracted values are closer to the original values. Though the values may
                    differ by large amount, this happens for every colour in every pixel and so it becomes
                    negligible on a large scale.

                <p class="text-content">
                    Also to note that the number of bits we use to replace also determines the quality of the
                    output image. If we use lesser number of bits to be replaced we get different results.

                <br>

                <p class="text-content">
                    The basic idea in this process is to hide plain text data into an image. Given an image, the
                    user is prompted to input the text to be hidden, and a secret key. This text data is then
                    stored into the image. While extraction, the user is prompted to input the secret key first,
                    if the secret key is correct then the hidden text is displayed to the user, else the hidden
                    text is not displayed.

                <h5>2.1 Process</h5>

                <p class="text-content">
                    To be able to hide plain text data into an image, we will first need to know how many
                    LSB bits from the pixels values we will be replacing. For this implementation just 1-bit is
                    used for every pixel. So the basic idea is to choose a set of pixels in an image, replace their
                    last
                    bit using the binary representation of the text. The process is as shown in Fig. 4.
                </p>

                <p class="text-content">
                    To replace the bits into the image, first we will have to convert the text into binary
                    representation as well. We achieve this by converting every character from the text to its
                    corresponding <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_html_ascii.asp"
                        target="_blank">ASCII</a> value (which is an integer). Further converting this integer value
                    into binary representation will give us the binary representation of each character from
                    the text. Using the binary representation of each of the character we append a special
                    character/identifier which will be useful during extraction process. After that's done, we
                    produce a
                    continuous <em>stream of bits</em>
                    which will be replaced in the pixels.

                <p class="text-content">
                    Side note, the replacement can be done in any of the pixels, like for example, if the length
                    <em>stream of bits</em> is
                    450,
                    then the replacement can be done in the first 450 pixels only. This can be done anyway,
                    depending
                    upon the implementation.
                    The replacement can be done only in the red pixels or blue, or all three of them.
                </p>

                <p class="text-content">
                    In this implementation, as we loop around individual pixels, at every iteration the sum of the
                    indexes suppose <em>i</em> and <em>j</em>, <em>sum = i + j</em>
                    is calculated, depending upon the divisibility of <em>sum</em> by 3, the pixel is either chosen
                    as
                    red, green or blue and replacement is done at the particular index of the image – <em> (i, j)
                        th</em>
                    position/index.

                <p class="text-content">
                    As we have seen that every color in a pixel has an 8-bit representation, we will extract the
                    binary representation of the characters from the text in 8-bit representation as well. As shown
                    in
                    Fig. 5. Doing
                    this also helps ease the extraction process.

                <p class="text-content">
                    So during the process, we produce a continuous stream of bits from the
                    text Fig. 5; this stream of bits is then used to replace the last LSB in the corresponding
                    pixels.
                    For every
                    required pixel in the image, the last bit of that pixel is replaced by an individual bit from
                    the
                    <em>stream
                        of bits</em>.
                    The output is the image with the pixel values modified.

                <h5>2.2 Extraction</h5>

                <p class="text-content">
                    During the extraction process (with the encrypted image as input), we select the
                    appropriate pixels where the replacement was originally done. Then for these pixels, the
                    last bit is extracted and again a <em>stream of bits</em> is produced. Using the <em>stream of
                        bits</em>, at
                    every iteration, 8-bits from <em>stream of bits</em> are selected and converted to integer and
                    then
                    converted to
                    character (reverse of what we had done during encryption). Every character produced
                    is appended to the final text. Also each character is compared to the special identifier so
                    as to stop the process as soon as the special identifier is found. The output is the hidden
                    text extracted from the image.
